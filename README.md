# Crazy Kitchen - A different form for implementing a distributed system.

This project is a distributed system that simulates a restaurant kitchen.

The idea is to use a different approach for implementing a distributed system. Instead of using a traditional approach, where we have a server and clients, we have a set of nodes that communicate with each other without dependency between them.
